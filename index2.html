    <h1>SHERLOCK HOLMES</h1>
    <h2>"A Scandal in Bohemia"</h2>
    <h3>Publication : July 1891 </h3>
    <p>The King of Bohemia engages Holmes to recover an indiscreet photograph showing him 
        with the renowned beauty, adventuress and opera singer Irene Adler‍—‌the revelation 
        of which would derail his marriage to a daughter of the King of Scandinavia. In
         disguise, Holmes witnesses Adler marry the man she truly loves, then by means of an
          elaborate stratagem discovers the photograph's hiding place. But when Holmes and the 
          king return to retrieve the photo, they find Adler has fled the country with it, leaving 
          behind a letter for Holmes and a portrait of herself for the King. The king allows Holmes 
          to retain the portrait as a souvenir.</p>
